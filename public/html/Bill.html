              <p>(CNN)Democrats in Congress are negotiating a sweeping budget reconciliation package that is the centerpiece of President Joe Biden's domestic agenda.

                The 10-year spending plan, originally priced at $3.5 trillion, marks the biggest step in the Democrats' drive to expand education, health care and child care support, as well as tackling the climate crisis and making further investments in infrastructure. But it has also raised concerns among moderate Democrats in both chambers who worry some of the elements of the package go too far and are too costly.
                With only narrow majorities in both chambers of Congress, Democrats are under pressure to finalize the package, which party leaders have pledged to move in tandem with a separate $1 trillion infrastructure bill that's already been approved by the Senate and is waiting for a vote in the House before it can be signed by Biden.<p>

              <p> "Life, Liberty & Levin" host Mark Levin accused congressional Democrats of running a "Ponzi scheme" in their quest to pass the $3.5 trillion social spending bill by the end of the month.

                The social spending package assembled by Democrats is set to be voted on by the House on Sept. 27. Many details of the legislation remain unclear, Levin said, faulting Democrats for hiding controversial spending provisions in "omnibus bills bigger than any telephone book in America."
                
                "Something is about to happen in the next couple of days," Levin told viewers at the start of his show on Sunday. 
                
                
                "You've heard about it in a platitudinous way, but very few specifics. I have spent a lot of time trying to dig up all the specificsâ€¦but the Democrats are very good at Ponzi schemes," the host said.  "In the private sector, if you're involved in a Ponzi scheme, you go to prison for a very long time. In the public sector, if you're involved in a Ponzi scheme, you're considered righteous and compassionate and so forth. And that's what the Democrats do."
