          <p> (CNN)Pain and anger over the death of George Floyd spilled over into multiple cities across the country hours after the former Minneapolis officer seen in video with his knee on Floyd's neck was arrested and charged with murder.

            Demonstrators funneled their anguish in cities like Atlanta, New York and Washington into chants, signs and outbreaks of violence, smashing windows and setting vehicles ablaze.
            In Minneapolis, roughly 1,000 people marched peacefully along the city's major freeway Interstate 35, hours after a curfew went into effect. One black man held a sign that read, "Am I next?"
            Eventually the marchers made it to the 5th Precinct where some demonstrators threw rocks or bottles at police.</p>

            Minneapolis firefighter Korboi "KB" Balla says his dream was always to open a sports bar, something he almost achieved after "countless hours" working on the project.

              His initial open date in March had to be pushed back because of the coronavirus pandemic. He was ready to finally open his doors in June, but that plan came to a crashing halt when rioters destroyed his business on Wednesday.
              "I don't know what I'm going to do," a teary-eyed Balla told a CBS affiliate. The outlet reported that Balla invested his life savings into opening the bar which looters infiltrated as cameras were rolling.

             "We've been working so hard for this place. This is not just for me. This is for my family," Balla says on the video.


              On a GoFundMe for rebuilding his bar, he confirmed that it was destroyed Thursday night.
              "The building and my business was completely burned down last night," he said. "I am devastated but I know something positive will come out of all this. Stay blessed everyone!"
              In an update, he said: "To find out that the countless hours, hard work, late nights away from my kids, and family had all been for nothing was soul-shattering. It is not the material things, more so the time that cannot be reclaimed."
              Created just a day ago, KB Balla's fundraiser has already surpassed its goal of $100,000. As of Friday evening, the total was over $300,000 and nearly 12,000 people had donated.
              Twyana Balla, KB's wife, posted footage of the scene on Facebook, and condemned the idea that the riots were somehow achieving justice for George Floyd, who died earlier this week after a police encounter caught on video that went viral and prompted protests in multiple U.S. cities.
